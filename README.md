# iiv-attributes-shortcode
Provides a shortcode to display a horizontal list of WooCommerce product attributes.

This merely changes the output to an unordered list and include commas until the list item. The plugin is from [99w's Product Attributes Shortcode](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wcpas-product-attributes-shortcode/#description). This was my first attempt at PHP and learning how to develop Wordpress Plugins.

## Usage

```
[iiv_attributes attribute="taxonomy_name"]
```
